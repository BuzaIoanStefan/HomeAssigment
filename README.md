This repository contains solutions for three programming exercises implemented in Java, using Spring Boot where necessary.

Exercise 1: Binary Tree Operations

Implement a class representing a binary tree with integer-valued nodes. Example:

     5
   /   \
  3     2
 / \
10  11

Methods implemented:

Find the maximum value in the tree.

Calculate the depth of the tree.

Exercise 2: Ping-Pong Multithreading

Implement a multithreading solution where:

One thread prints "ping" and another prints "pong".

Execution stops after 5 seconds.

The output alternates as follows:

ping
pong
ping
pong

Exercise 3: Maximum Sum of Pairs with Matching Digits

Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum of two numbers that share the same first and last digits.

Example Cases:

Input: [130, 191, 200, 10] ‚Üí Output: 140 (130 + 10)

Input: [405, 45, 300, 300] ‚Üí Output: 600 (300 + 300)

Input: [50, 222, 49, 52, 25] ‚Üí Output: -1 (No valid pairs)
